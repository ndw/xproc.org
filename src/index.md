<h1>XProc</h1>

XProc is an XML based programming language for processing documents in pipelines: chaining conversions and other steps together to achieve the desired results. This site is dedicated to XProc version 3.0 and higher. 

The current stable version of the Xproc specification is [3.0](https://xproc.org/specifications.html#current). Version 3.1, a relatively minor update, is currently (2024) under development.

XProc has been around, in its 1.0 version, since 2010. All information about this older version can be found [here](https://archive.xproc.org).

The following are important sources of information about XProc 3.0:

* To whet your appetite, read the [XProc introduction](introduction.html)  or have a look at the [Introduction to XProc 3.0](https://www.xml.com/articles/2019/11/05/introduction-xproc-30/) article at the [xml.com website](https://www.xml.com/).
* There's an *XProc 3.0 Programmer Reference* book, which you can order [here](https://xmlpress.net/publications/xproc-3-0/).
* We have collected as many learning materials about XProc 3.0 as we could find [here](learning.html) (conference talks, webinars, articles, etc.). 
* There are, of course, the [formal specifications](specifications.html) of the XProc 3.0 language.
* To run XProc you need one of the [XProc processors](processors.html)
  * Conformance checking of these processors is done using the [XProc test suite](test-suite.html) 
* You can find XProc on GitHub at [https://github.com/xproc](https://github.com/xproc)
* Join in or visit the archives of the [XProc mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xproc-dev/): `xproc-dev@w3.org`

The XProc specification is maintained by Achim&#160;Berndzen, Gerrit&#160;Imsieke, Erik&#160;Siegel and Norman&#160;Tovey-Walsh.
